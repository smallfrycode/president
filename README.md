## Overview of Code
### Card Class
--Card Class info goes here--

### Player Class
--Player Class info goes here (talk about HumanPlayer and ComputerPlayer child classes under this)--
The goal of the HumanPlayer class is to represents a human-controlled player in the card game, inheriting from the Player class. 
It allows the user to make decisions about which cards to play or to pass their turn, validating their inputs against the game state and their hand. 
It uses method, turn, prompts the player to select cards to play or pass their turn. 
Input is validated through a helper function that parses card strings into Card objects using regular expressions, ensuring ranks and suits are valid and that the selected cards are in the playerâ€™s hand. 
If the input is invalid or mismatched, the player is re-prompted until valid input is provided. 
The method returns the chosen cards as a list or None if the player passes.


### GameState Class
Provides information on the current state of the game.

#### GameState.__init__(players, last_played, current_player)
The goal of this method is to initialize the GameState class and create the necessary attributes to represent the state of the game visually.
- players (list): a collection of all the players as a list
- last_played (set): the last card(s) which were played as a set
- current_player (Player): the person who is currently playing
- out (list): all the players who have emptied their hand

#### GameState.__str__()
The goal of this method is the show an informal representation of the state of the game. It will create a string representing the players of the game with their corresponding roles. Then it will create a string representing the last card(s) that were played on the table. Then it will create a string representing the hand of the current player. Lastly, it will return a string representing all of this information (players and corresponding roles, last hand played, and current player's hand).

#### GameState.results()
The goal of this method is to return the results of the game in a string that shows each persons name and their corresponding role. 

### Game Class
The skeleton of the program, sets up the game environment and controls the game.

#### Game.__init__(players)
The goal of this method is to create the necessary attributes in order for the game to function.
- deck (list): a collection of all the cards in the deck
- players (list): a collection of all the players
- out (list): a collection of all the players who have emptied their hand
- roles_left (list): a list of all the available roles which can be won during the game
- current_player (Player): the person who is currently playing
- last_played (list or None): the last card(s) which were played

#### Game.shuffle()
The goal of this method is to shuffle the deck of cards. It will first create a temporary list of unshuffled cards using the `Card` class ([see documentation above](#card-class)) to create Card objects. Afterwards the `choice()` function from the `random` python module is used to choose a random card from the list of unshuffled cards. This chosen card is than appended to `Game.deck` and removed from the unshuffled cards list.

#### Game.deal()
The goal of this method is to deal out all the cards evenly from the deck, to each player's hand. A while loop is used to continue dealing out all the cards until the deck is empty and variables `max_index` and `index` are used to iterate through the players. The variable `index` starts at 1 in order to follow the "left-of-the-dealer" rule and cards are added + removed using `pop()`. After all cards are dealt, the method then organizes a player's card in ascending order (by card rank) using the `sorted()` and `lambda` functions.

#### Game.create_roles()
The goal of this method is to set up the possible roles player's can win. This is dependent on the amount of players who are currently playing. A dictionary is made with numbers to organize the list of roles and help choose what is appropriate.
```
self.roles_left = {
    2: ["President", "Trash"],
    3: ["President", "Neutral 1", "Trash"],
    4: ["President", "Vice President", "Vice Trash", "Trash"],
    5: ["President", "Vice President", "Neutral 1", "Vice Trash", "Trash"],
    6: ["President", "Vice President", "Neutral 1", "Neutral 2", "Vice Trash", "Trash"],
    7: ROLES.copy()
}[player_count]
```

#### Game.last_card_bomb(last_play)
The goal of this method is to help determine if a player's final play was a bomb (i.e 2). It will loop through the list, `last_play`, which was the play made by the previous player who completed their turn. If a bomb was played then it returns True, otherwise it returns False.

#### Game.state()
The goal of this method is to grab the current state of the game. It returns an informal representation of a GameState object ([see documentation above](#gamestate-class)).

#### Game.play(first_game)
The goal of this method is to run the actual game. It first checks to make sure that a game hasn't been played yet (i.e `first_game = True`). If a game was previously played, then it will sort player's based on their roles and reset `Game.out` and `Game.last_played`. The game will then run the `shuffle()`, `deal()`, and `create_roles()` methods in order to set up the environment. From here the game will continue to play until 1 player is left.

When iterating through each player, the game will keep track of how many skips were made. If no one is able to play, the `skip_count` is used to help reset the table and let the last player who completed their turn to play anything of their choosing. After this, the game will ask for a response (`player.turn(Game.state())` -> [see documentation for player](#player-class)) and determine if it is valid:
- None -> player has skipped
- `Card.rank = 2` (must be played prior to other cards) -> player has played a bomb
- `Card.validate(Game.last_played, response) = True` -> valid play made
- None of the above -> invalid play, prompts user for a response again

If a valid play is made, the game will remove any cards from the player's hand if any were played. If a 2 was played and the player still has a hand, then the thread will continue and let the player go again.
```
if player.hand:
    continue
valid_response = True # this is not executed because the player still has a hand
```

If a 2 was the last card played, then the lowest role available will be given, otherwise the highest role available will be given. The player will then be removed from the `Game.players` list and added to the `Game.out` list.

Once the game has concluded, the last player will be removed from the `Game.players` list, added to the `Game.out` list, given the last role available, and the `GameState.results()` method will be called in order to retrieve and display the results of the game.

### main(players, computers)
This function sets up and starts the card game, managing both human and computer players while ensuring the total player count does not exceed the maximum defined by ROLES. 
It takes the list of human player names (players) and the number of computer players (computers), adjusting the counts if needed. The game runs in a loop, starting with game.play() and tracking whether it's the first game round. 
After each round, the user is prompted to play again, with the loop continuing until the user opts out.
